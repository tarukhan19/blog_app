AuthEvent class represents different authentication-related user actions (events) in the BLoC
 pattern. Events define what triggers the authentication process, such as signing up or logging in.

üõ† Breakdown of AuthEvent
1Ô∏è‚É£ AuthSignUp ‚Üí Triggered when a user signs up with name, email, and password.
2Ô∏è‚É£ AuthSignIn ‚Üí Triggered when a user logs in with email and password.

‚úÖ A sealed class is a special type of class that restricts inheritance to only within the same file.
  These classes cannot be instantiated because they are meant to be extended only.
